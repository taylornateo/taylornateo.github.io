            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <p>My target audience for my viewfinder forecast site is photographers. My site will be focused on
                styling for photograpahers and how they would like to have a weather site done. Photographers focus
                on what the weather will be like on certain days so that they can determine when to head out and take
                pictures.

            <h2>Jake</h2>
            <p>Jake is a professional photographer and is often hired to take pictures for event, weddings,
                and other activities that people hire him for. In order to prepare he will check the weather to
                see how it will be outside while he is at these events. The weather plays a key role for how the lighting
                will be at the event he is hired for. So it is crucial for him to know how it will be outside.

            <h2>Sarah</h2>
            <p>Sarah is a scenic photographer and is always looking for new places to find to take pictures.
                Each day she sets out to new spots in the town or out in hiking trails to find interesting
                scenery that can be used for a good photograph. She is constantly checking the weather to see
                how the weather will affect her picture taking that day. She likes to know if it will be cloudy
                or sunny outside.</p>

                <li>Hannah is looking for a new way to take pictures. She is out taking pictures and can use the weather to her advantage.</li>
                <li>Jake wants to be quick when taking his picture at a wedding. If he has his settings set on his camera for the right lighting before he gets there it will save time.</li>
                <li>Hannah is deciding if she should go out to shoot today. She does not want to get her equipment wet.</li>
