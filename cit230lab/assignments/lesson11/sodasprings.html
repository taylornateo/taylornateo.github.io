            <h2>Local nonprofit hosting snowman competition to raise awareness of child abuse prevention </h2>
            <p class="author">By Silas Wright</p>
            <p class="content">
                POCATELLO — The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the election and political tensions have dominated news
                headlines in 2020 and made it an eventful year. A local nonprofit is hoping to get people talking about
                another issue with a virtual competition.

                The Bannock Youth Foundation’s Communities Aligned in Prevention Efforts is hosting a virtual snowman
                competition to help families have discussions about child abuse. The organization typically hosts
                community events to educate and raise awareness about child abuse prevention efforts. Many of those
                events were canceled this year to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

                Program Coordinator Shannon Fox tells EastIdahoNews.com the snowman competition can encourage families
                and organizations to have fun together at home while still having discussions about something that
                impacts children nationwide and in eastern Idaho.

                “We are all kind of exhausted by what’s going on,” Fox says. “We still need to be having these important
                conversations.”

                Anyone is welcome to participate in the competition. To enter, the family or organization simply has to
                make a snowman. It can be made out of snow, cookies, paper or anything else you can think of. Once it’s
                complete, take a picture and upload it to C.A.P.E’s Facebook page..
            </p>
            <p class="content-2">

                In order for a family to be considered for a prize, they also have to download and fill out the Family
                Code of Conduct worksheet. The document, created by the nonprofit organization Darkness to Light, has
                been used by C.A.P.E for years. It helps families establish expectations for children, ranging from how
                they treat others to what will be allowed when it comes to sleepovers or the internet.

                Every family that posts both a photo and the code of conduct form will be entered into a raffle to win
                one of five prizes.

                The group is encouraging businesses and organizations to get involved as well. Organizations who post
                their photo and code of conduct will be eligible to win one of five trophies for most creative,
                funniest, largest or craftiest snowman. There is also a trophy for best snowman collage for
                organizations with many participants.

                Despite the pandemic, Fox hopes families and businesses will participate and have these conversations
                with those they know.

                “Everything is happening in a way that no one has really anticipated … but we still can’t drop the ball
                for our children,” says Fox.

                The competition gets underway Dec. 1. Visit the Facebook page for more information.
